# ZigZagProduct
This is a report on the Zig-Zag Graph Product paper by O. Reingold, S. Vadhan,  and A. Wigderson. Although the category of this topic falls under Computational Complexity, mathematical
graphs have played a huge role in the field of Artificial Intelligence, from artificial neural networks to unsupervised learning methods such as spectral clustering, to random-walk applications
such as Google's PageRank, to human memory and memory retrieval methods modeled by graphs.

This paper explores the construction of expander graphs using a mathematical operation known as the Zig-Zag graph product. The paper shows how to construct such graphs using the zig-zag products in an efficient manner
